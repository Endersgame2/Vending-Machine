Hey Chris, There are some errors in my code 
Sometimes it gives error with parseInt, sometimes it's while adding new quantity to the previous ones and it also falls down sometimes when you try to buy overquantity and it sells it.
Im so sorry for using classes but I treid with function but I was just getting confused; Thus I end up writing my code with class. I am so sorry about that but I'm use to class.
